# Module_5

# FINAL UPDATE
In the end I realised a couple of things:
- It is really annoying to use code written by other people if you do not understand why they wrote something.
- Always make sure you read the prereqs of the assignment first
- Keep checking your prereqs throughout the process of writing code, because if you don't you are going to kick yourself
- Sometimes it is okay to skip something while learning

From this Module I learnt (well already knew how to to, but it was the goal here) 
- how to use different tabs in Processing 
- difference in return values

I ended up with code that I would have had to rewrite completely...
All and all I decided (after consulting with my tutor) to skip the rewrite. 
If it had been Java or C++ I had been working in it would have made a good exercise to rewrite the code, but seeing that in a couple of weeks time I will no longer be using Processing (plus the inherent bugs of Processing itself) it was best not to.
I learnt what I needed from it and will be continuing with Module 6



Return Values


Module 5 of the Processing Course

This will be about Return Values. Should be interesing :)
